But still it is better to find a way to acquire those physical activities in a structured way in order to ensure that the activities are targeting all the parts of the body and to develop their motor skills correctly. That is why in school, it is important to have physical education courses or subjects. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Unfortunately, one of the hardest hit norms in the current pandemic situation is the education sector. While we may all agree that there is no better way to do it but through face-to-face sesion, the question remains if we want to take the risk sending kids back to school and quite possibly get them infected. Of course, the obvious answer to this is — no. So now we are faced with a dilemma. We want to put kids back to school or to schooling but don’t want to expose them to a great risk.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Enter online school. To adapt to the current situation, educators turn to technology in order to mitigate and minimize the disruption brought by the pandemic to our school system. For most parts, online schooling has been observed to work. Yet still, a lot of difficulties and challenges exist. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Among these challenges is about the delivery of physical education courses through online means. There is no question that physical education subjects are as important as the academic ones. Simply dropping it out of the online curriculum is out of the question. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>So, how exactly do you deliver physical education courses to online schoolers, especially for kids? 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Online learning has provided solutions in academic arenas, but can it help our children’s health as well. Let’s enter the online world of physical education (PE).
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>The Benefits of Online PE
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Just like adults in the “real world,” students have to choose when, where, and how they exercise. Thus establishing a habit they can continue after class is over. In addition to participating in regular physical activity, students learn the principles of health and fitness, not just the rules of a sport. By choosing activities they enjoy, students are more likely to get started and stick with it over time. Students receive individualized feedback from an instructor—kind of like having their own personal trainer. Students perform in a non-competitive environment. This is ideal for students who are out of shape or uncomfortable in a group environment (often those who do poorly in a face to face PE setting).
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Everything is tailored to the individual. With structured guidance they set their own goals, design their own program, and evaluate their progress.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>In addition to the individual benefits, providing an online solution can be beneficial for schools and students in many additional circumstances. Including:
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>-- For small schools with limited facilities to offer PE
</strong></p><p><strong>-- For students that are falling behind
</strong></p><p><strong>-- For student that want to get ahead or take more rigorous academic classes
</strong></p><p><strong>-- For IEP students
</strong></p><p><strong>-- To provide summer school options, and
</strong></p><p><strong>-- To increase a teacher’s student load while decreasing a teacher’s workload.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>How Does It Work?
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>While online PE sounds like an oxymoron, it can and does work. Here’s the basics:
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>-- Students conduct a fitness assessment, analyze it according to national standards, set personal goals, and choose or design an exercise program to follow.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>-- Students view modeling through pictures, video, and instruction of a variety of skills and exercises.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>-- Students submit pictures or videos of themselves performing specific skills or exercises so an instructor can provide feedback.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>-- Students view informational lessons, participate in online discussion forums about health and fitness topics, and complete weekly assignments.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>-- Students must meet a weekly physical activity requirement and keep record on a detailed fitness log.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>-- Physical activity must be verified via a supervising adult and/or an upload enabled heart rate monitor.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>It’s true that online PE may not be the primary and independent answer to solving the childhood obesity problem. Yet, it can certainly provide a personalized physical education experience for a student that paves the road to a healthy lifestyle. Students and schools can benefit from exploring an online PE solution.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Here are some creative ideas to encourage physical activity beyond "go play outside"—including activities and exercises you can do together with kids.
</strong></p><p><strong>Indoor movement ideas for kids
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>If you're having a bad weather week or you live in an urban area without easy access to a backyard, letting the kids run around outside might not be an option for you right now. But kids can still get in plenty of physical activity without leaving the house—it just takes a bit of creativity.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>1. Twister
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Twister is fun, encourages flexibility and balance, and is perfect for a rainy day or if you don't have an outdoor space available right now.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>2. Dance + freeze
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Adding a "freeze" element to a living room dance party makes it more fun for kids while also encouraging them to practice their balance.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>3. Yoga
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Practicing yoga together is a great way to challenge balance and coordination while also getting some much needed zen time as a family.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>4. Beanbag toss
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>This super simple activity is great for kids of all different ages and abilities as you can easily make it more or less challenging. Set up two baskets, one full of beanbags or soft balls. Your child can practice throwing a beanbag from one basket to another to work on coordination. Move the baskets further apart as they get the hang of it.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>5. Jump rope
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Jump rope is the perfect indoor PE activity because it uses up so much energy, requires very little space and is excellent practice for coordination.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Outdoor movement ideas for kids
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>If you have outdoor space available, encourage your child to get out there and play as much as possible. Free play is excellent physical activity—and if you play alongside your child, you just may get some much needed endorphins. Kick a ball around the yard together, play catch or blow up that inflatable pool to splash around in as soon as it's warm enough.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Here are a few specific activities to try if your kid needs some inspiration to get out there, or if you want to work with them on gross motor skills.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>1. Hopscotch
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Hopscotch is excellent for helping kids improve balance and coordination because of all of the rapid changes in movement required. Get out the sidewalk chalk and set up hopscotch on your patio or driveway and hop along with each other.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>2. Obstacle course
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Enlist your child's help in setting up an obstacle course in the backyard. Get creative with what you have available to make it fun and challenging. Use garden stones or an old 2x4 to create a balance beam, mark a pathway for them to run or ride their bike on, set up a big bucket for them to throw a ball in.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>If you don't have an outdoor space, you can still turn a playroom, garage, basement, or even your kid's bedroom into an obstacle course. Set up different stations like pillows for them to jump over, a row of chairs for them to crawl under, or a line made from painter's tape on the floor for them to walk or run on while balancing a beanbag on their head.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>3. Foursquare
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Sometimes the simple, time-tested games are the best! Draw numbered squares on your driveway and challenge each other to bounce the ball to a family member standing in whatever number square you call out. (You do need four people for a traditional foursquare game, but if you have fewer than four people in your household, you can create a simple variation by drawing a triangle or a rectangle with fewer spots.)
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>4. Follow the leader
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Line up a single file and let each family member take turns being the "leader." The leader decides how the group will move around the backyard. Think crawling around the perimeter, walking backwards (carefully), hopping on one foot, going down the slide if you have one.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>5. Red light green light
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Ask your kids to stand along the fence in the backyard. Stand across the yard from them. When you call "Green Light!" they can advance toward you and when you call "Red Light!" they stop. Change up the type of movement they use, from jumping to tiptoeing, and make sure to switch roles so they get a chance to lead too.
